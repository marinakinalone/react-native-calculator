## About this repository

### branch 'master'
This is the branch to deploy the app on the web, using React Native Web. For the mobile version of the app, use the branch 'dev-marinakinalone'

### branch 'dev-marinakinalone'
The react native version of my code.
### branch 'salt-lab'
The first branch used with my team when we started learning react native.
  
## Deployment
[nihon no dentaku](https://https://nihon-no-dentaku.netlify.app/)

## Installation

```bash
npm i
npm run start

```

## What I have learned from this project
Initially, this project is a simple exercise made to learn React Native with other team members (using mob programming). I then decided to explore React Native a bit deeper to continue learning and try out new things:

- using neumorphic style for the UI.
- use a language with a different set of characters from the arabic numbers to practice logic reasoning.

I've never heard of React Native Web before and therefore, it was a good opportunity to try it out in order to deploy a react native on the web.

## What's next to do?
- Display the result in Japanese kanjis
- Implement the "percentage" function
- Check that the styling is consistent from one platform to another (ie. BorderRadius is not working on iOS). It seems like the view shrinks on mobile...
