# JavaScript React Native - Calculator

## A. Scenario

It's not uncommon for companies to try out new channels to reach their customers with, even though that might differ from your normal approach.

Imagine that you are working at a web shop and then one day the marketing (always the marketing) head honcho walks through the door of the developers den. This is trouble, you know it will be trouble:

> Folks! My daughter showed me SnapChat yesterday - why don't we have an app? We only have the website. Build an app, will ya? Just to show that we can - make a calculator or something.

Here we go - now all of a sudden we need to become phone developers... How are we gonna hack ourselves out of this one?

## B. What you will be working on today

Today you are going to build a calculator app in React Native using Expo. The app should support the basics calcation methods (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and work just like the built-in calculation:

1. Enter first number
2. Enter calculation method
3. Enter second number
4. Present the result

## C. Testing and linting setup

The main focus of this exercise is to get the tooling for React Native up and running, things like:

* The Expo CLI
* The developement server
* The simulators for IPhone and Android
* and the entire development flow

Therefor we will not focus on the linting and testing aspects in this exercise.

## D. Lab instructions

* Design the application as one single screen
* Think about splitting components for the different parts of the UI
* Test the application in your simulators

Once you have finished the application you can:

* Deploy the application to Expo so that you can test it out on your own phone.

Good luck and have fun!
