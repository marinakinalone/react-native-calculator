## What I have learned from this project
Initially, this project is a simple exercise made to learn React Native with other team members (using mob programming). I then decided to explore React Native a bit deeper to continue learning and try out new things:
- using neumorphic style for the UI.
- convert arabic numbers to hiraganas
